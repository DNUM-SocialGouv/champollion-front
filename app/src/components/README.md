# Components

This project uses the official [French Design System](https://www.systeme-de-design.gouv.fr/) called **DSFR**, through the [dedicated React library](https://github.com/codegouvfr/react-dsfr).

Most of the components come from the DSFR.

The others are located here.

## Unit tests

There aren't unit tests at the moment ðŸ™ˆ.
It's bad...

This project started out as a proof of concept, with short time and a lot to do, and frontend tests were not proritized.

We hope to add unit tests in Jest in the nearby future!
