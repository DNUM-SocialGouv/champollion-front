# App

This folder contains the front-end app.

In a typical React app, this would be the root of the repo.
However, the repo also contains two other main folders (**oauth2-proxy** and **reverse-proxy**) because the project need those those 3 Docker images to be deployed.

Check the documentation [here](../documentation/).
